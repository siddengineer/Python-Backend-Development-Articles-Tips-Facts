🔑 Big Things You Should Know

Python Upgrade Needed
Django 6.0 only works with Python 3.12 or 3.13.
👉 If you’re on older Python, upgrade before moving to Django 6.0.

Built-in Security (CSP)
Django now has Content Security Policy (CSP) built in.
👉 This makes your site safer from attacks like XSS without extra libraries.

Template Partials
New way to reuse parts of templates easily with {% partialdef %}.
👉 No need to create many small template files.

Background Tasks in Django
Django now has its own @task decorator.
👉 You can run simple tasks in the background (without Celery/RQ).
But: production still better with Celery for heavy jobs.

Better ORM (Database Queries)

More options in aggregates (order_by, AnyValue, etc.)

JSON fields work better (like negative indexing).

Composite keys supported in more places.
👉 Queries become more powerful and flexible.

Admin Panel Updates

Uses latest icons (Font Awesome).

Password form easier to customize.

Stronger password hashing.
👉 Slightly nicer and more secure admin.

⚠️ Things That Might Break

Only Python 3.12+ works – older versions won’t run.

Some database backend methods renamed – custom backends may fail.

Old APIs removed – e.g., get_cache_name() gone.

Defaults changed – auto fields now default to BigAutoField.

Stricter errors – ORM may throw new exceptions (like on failed updates).

✅ What You Should Do

Upgrade Python to 3.12+ now.

Test your code with Django 6.0 in a staging/dev setup.

Check your third-party packages (they must support Django 6.0).

Try new tasks and partials where useful.

Turn on CSP for better security.
