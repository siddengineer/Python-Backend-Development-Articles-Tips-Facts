🏢 Django Multi-Tenancy at Scale: Beyond Basic SaaS Patterns
🌱 1. Multi-Tenancy Basics (the “starter pack”)

Shared DB, shared schema: All tenants share the same DB tables, just separated by a tenant_id column.

Shared DB, separate schema: Same DB, but each tenant has its own schema (Postgres makes this easy).

Separate DB per tenant: Each tenant has their own DB. Strong isolation, but harder to manage.

👉 At small scale, these work fine. But at scale (hundreds of tenants, millions of rows), problems show up: migrations, indexing, noisy neighbors, and ops complexity.

🚀 2. Scaling Patterns (Beyond Basics)
🔹 a) Hybrid Model

Small tenants → shared schema (cheap + efficient).

Big enterprise tenants → dedicated DB/schema.
👉 Optimizes cost + performance.

🔹 b) Sharding by Tenant

Instead of one massive DB, tenants are sharded across multiple DBs.

Example: Tenant A–M on DB1, Tenant N–Z on DB2.
👉 Helps avoid single DB bottlenecks.

🔹 c) Connection Routing

Django’s DATABASE_ROUTERS + libraries like django-multitenant
 allow per-tenant DB routing.

You can scale horizontally while keeping code simple.

🔹 d) Row-Level Security (RLS)

Postgres RLS can enforce tenant isolation at the DB level:

CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation
ON orders
USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);


👉 Even if your code leaks, DB won’t. Hardcore isolation.

🔹 e) Caching & Rate-Limiting Per Tenant

Tenants with huge traffic can hog cache/memory.

Use Redis namespaces per tenant (e.g., tenant123:user_sessions).

Apply per-tenant rate-limits to stop one customer from slowing everyone down.

⚡ 3. Challenges at Scale

Migrations → Running schema changes for 1000 tenants? Painful. Solution: rolling migrations + background jobs.

Index bloat → Shared DB with millions of rows needs tenant-aware indexing.

Query performance → Always filter by tenant_id. Use Django managers/middleware to enforce this.

Data residency/compliance → Some enterprise tenants may require region-specific DBs (EU, US, India).

Observability → Logs + metrics must be per tenant, or debugging is impossible.

🛠 4. Tools & Libraries

django-tenants → Schema-based tenancy.

django-multitenant (Citus) → Shared-table, sharded, scalable.

Postgres RLS → Strong isolation with minimal app logic.

ProxySQL / Citus / Vitess → For massive horizontal scaling.

🎸 5. Rockstar Moves for SaaS Builders

Pick isolation wisely (shared vs schema vs DB).

Automate tenant onboarding (DB/schema migrations on signup).

Centralize auth & billing, but separate tenant data.

Observability dashboards per tenant (Grafana/Prometheus).

Plan for “escape hatches” → Big enterprise tenant can be migrated to its own DB without rewriting app.
