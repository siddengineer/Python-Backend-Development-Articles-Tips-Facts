1. Follow Djangoâ€™s Project Structure

Stick to Djangoâ€™s recommended project layout â€” apps for modularity, settings.py split into dev/staging/prod, and separate files for static/media. It keeps things clean and scalable.

2. Use Virtual Environments

Always isolate your dependencies with venv or pipenv. This avoids version conflicts and makes deployment easier.

3. Keep Secrets Secret

Never hardcode passwords, API keys, or database credentials. Use environment variables or packages like django-environ.

4. Optimize Database Queries

Use select_related and prefetch_related to reduce N+1 queries. Also, index frequently queried fields to boost performance.

5. Write Reusable, Modular Apps

Think in terms of apps not projects. Each app should solve one problem well so you can reuse it in future projects.

6. Test Early, Test Often

Use Djangoâ€™s built-in test framework (pytest-django if you prefer) to write unit and integration tests. Continuous testing saves debugging headaches later.

7. Secure Your Application

Enable CSRF protection

Use HTTPS in production

Validate user inputs

Keep Django and third-party packages updated

ðŸ”¥ Bonus: Follow PEP 8 coding standards and use tools like Black or Flake8 to maintain code quality.
