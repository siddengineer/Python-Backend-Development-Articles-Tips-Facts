ðŸŽ¯ Why You Need Rate Limiting

A DoS (Denial of Service) attack floods your server with too many requests.

Without control, even one malicious script can crash your app.

Rate limiting ensures each user/IP can only send a limited number of requests in a time window.

ðŸª„ Rockstar Ways to Add Rate Limiting in Django
1. Use Django REST Framework Throttling (if using DRF)

Add throttling in settings.py:

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
        'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle'
    ],
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
        'anon': '50/min',   # 50 requests per minute for anonymous users
        'user': '100/min'   # 100 requests per minute per authenticated user
    }
}


ðŸ‘‰ Great if your app is API-heavy.

2. Django Ratelimit Middleware

Install:

pip install django-ratelimit


Usage in views:

from django_ratelimit.decorators import ratelimit

@ratelimit(key='ip', rate='5/m', block=True)
def my_view(request):
    return HttpResponse("You're safe, buddy!")


ðŸ‘‰ Blocks IPs making more than 5 requests per minute.

3. Nginx/Reverse Proxy Level Rate-Limiting

Even before requests hit Django:

limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=10r/s;
server {
    location / {
        limit_req zone=one burst=20 nodelay;
    }
}


ðŸ‘‰ Stops traffic floods at the server level. Super-efficient.

4. Redis + Token Bucket

Use Redis as a fast counter.

Store requests per user/IP in Redis.

Apply token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms.
ðŸ‘‰ Best for scaling apps.

5. Cloud-Based Protection (CDN/WAF)

Services like Cloudflare, AWS WAF, Akamai can block abusive traffic before it even touches your server.
ðŸ‘‰ Easy, powerful, but external.

âš¡ Rockstar Tips (Without Losing Your Cool)

Always start with reasonable limits (not too strict, not too open).

Log blocked requests â†’ helps in detecting real attackers.

Combine app-level + proxy-level rate limiting for max safety.

Allow some endpoints (like login) to have stricter rules.

Use CAPTCHA or challenge after multiple hits to reduce bot traffic.
