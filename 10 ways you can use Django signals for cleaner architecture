1. Keep Business Logic Out of Views

Instead of writing complex logic directly in views, trigger signals when events happen (e.g., "order_created") and let receivers handle side effects like sending confirmation emails.

2. Decouple Side Effects from Core Actions

Example: When a new user registers, the view should only handle saving the user. Signals can handle profile creation, sending welcome mail, and analytics logging separately.

3. Centralize Notifications

Use signals to send in-app or email notifications when certain model events occur (like comment added, order shipped) instead of scattering notification code across views and models.

4. Audit Logging

Hook into post_save or post_delete signals to record changes in an audit trail. Keeps audit logic clean and separate.

5. Cache Invalidation

Automatically clear or refresh cache when a model instance is updated or deleted. Example: invalidate product cache when its price changes.

6. Automated Related Model Updates

When saving an object, use a signal to update related models without mixing logic into save() methods. Example: Update total order value when an item is added.

7. Analytics and Tracking

Instead of cluttering business logic with tracking events, send a signal (e.g., purchase_completed) and let receivers log events to analytics services.

8. Background Task Triggers

Trigger Celery or Django background tasks from signals. Example: After uploading a file, send a signal to queue a background job for processing.

9. Security and Compliance Checks

Use signals to enforce business rules (e.g., deny deletion of certain objects) or log access for compliance. Keeps validation concerns modular.

10. Dynamic System Extensibility

Third-party apps or plugins can subscribe to your app’s signals to extend functionality without modifying core code. Example: Marketplace apps reacting to "payment_received".

✅ Key Benefit:
Signals promote separation of concerns, keeping your views, models, and utilities cleaner, while making your architecture more extensible and maintainable.
