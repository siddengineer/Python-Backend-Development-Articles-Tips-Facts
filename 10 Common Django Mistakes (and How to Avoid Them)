✅ 10 Common Django Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them)
1. Hardcoding secrets in settings.py

❌ Mistake: Writing DB passwords, API keys directly in code.

⏳ Wasted Time: Debugging leaks, migrating environments.

✅ Fix: Use environment variables (django-environ or .env files).

2. Using default SQLite in production

❌ Mistake: Running a production app on SQLite.

⏳ Wasted Time: Performance crashes under load.

✅ Fix: Use PostgreSQL/MySQL in production; SQLite only for quick dev/testing.

3. Forgetting database indexing

❌ Mistake: Queries become super slow with large datasets.

⏳ Wasted Time: Hours optimizing queries later.

✅ Fix: Add db_index=True to frequent search fields, use Django Debug Toolbar to analyze queries.

4. Not using select_related and prefetch_related

❌ Mistake: N+1 query problem (thousands of DB hits in loops).

⏳ Wasted Time: Debugging performance issues.

✅ Fix: Use select_related for foreign keys and prefetch_related for many-to-many fields.

5. Ignoring migrations conflicts

❌ Mistake: Multiple developers editing models → broken migrations.

⏳ Wasted Time: Rebuilding DB, losing data.

✅ Fix: Always run makemigrations + migrate carefully, use squashmigrations for cleanup.

6. Blocking the request cycle with heavy tasks

❌ Mistake: Doing email sending, PDF generation, or ML tasks inside views.

⏳ Wasted Time: Requests hang, server crashes.

✅ Fix: Use Celery, RQ, or Django-Q for background jobs.

7. Poor static & media file handling

❌ Mistake: Serving media files directly from Django in production.

⏳ Wasted Time: Slow file serving, broken uploads.

✅ Fix: Use WhiteNoise for static files, S3/Cloud Storage for media.

8. Writing business logic inside views

❌ Mistake: Fat views, messy code, hard to test.

⏳ Wasted Time: Refactoring & debugging later.

✅ Fix: Keep views thin, push logic to models (fat models) or services/helpers.

9. Forgetting to secure Django apps

❌ Mistake: Leaving DEBUG=True in production, weak CSRF/security headers.

⏳ Wasted Time: Fixing hacked apps.

✅ Fix: Always set DEBUG=False, configure ALLOWED_HOSTS, CSRF, XSS protections.

10. Reinventing the wheel

❌ Mistake: Writing your own user authentication, permissions, or admin dashboards.

⏳ Wasted Time: Weeks of unnecessary coding.

✅ Fix: Use Django’s built-in auth system, DRF permissions, Django Admin — they’re robust and extensible.

⚡ Quick Rule:
If you’re spending hours debugging Django, check first if it’s:
👉 (1) a DB query issue, (2) a config issue, or (3) reinventing something Django already has.
